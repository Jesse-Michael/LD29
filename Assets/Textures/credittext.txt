The game was developed for the 29th Ludum Dare game jam. This was my first Ludum Dare, and it was incredibly exciting/stressful. It was very challenging to get anything done in such a short amount of time. But very rewarding!! Participating in this game competition, and finishing with anything at all, makes me feel that my game developer dreams aren't dead yet.
