## Beneath The Surface

The theme for Ludum Dare 29 was "Beneath the Surface".

Fend off what lies beneath the surface.

You play a hero that wields a bow and fends of a giant for as long as you can. To fire an arrow, click on the scene and drag the mouse as if you were pulling back the arrow on the bow. The game use the angle from where you started and ended clicking, as well as the distance of the two points, to calculate a trajectory for the arrow. You must hit the giant to stop him from destroying you.
